# Linear Discriminant Analysis

Given the probability to be part of a class $C_k$ we select the class the maximizes the probability.

\\( \delta_k(x) = x^T{\sum}^{-1}{\mu_k} - \frac{1}{2}{\mu_k}^T{\sum}^{-1}{\mu_k} + log({\pi}_k) \\)


It works better when we could separate classes from some of their features.
